Objective: Developmental hemostasis and underlying disease complicates anticoagulation management during neonatal ECMO. Anticoagulation management utilizing ACT and aPTT during neonatal ECMO may be unreliable given poor correlation to heparin activity. Anti-factor Xa directed anticoagulation could be better suited in neonates as it directly measures heparin-bound antithrombin activity. We describe effects of an anti-Xa directed anticoagulation protocol for neonatal respiratory ECMO

Methods: We performed retrospective review of anticoagulation for first 120 hours in 34 infants placed on VA-ECMO at UPMC Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Pittsburgh NICU. Nineteen neonatal ECMO patients were from January 2017 until August 2018 when primarily aPTT was used for heparin management. Fifteen neonatal ECMO patients were from September 2018 until October 2019 when heparin management was driven by anti-Xa levels following change in anticoagulation protocol. For differences between pre and post protocol groups, Mann-Whitney U and Fisher Exact test were applied to demographics, clinical variables and outcomes.  

Results: Patients in new protocol group had statistically significant higher aPTT, AT-III and anti-Xa levels, with significantly lower plasma free hemoglobin levels and reduced need for plasmapheresis compared to the previous protocol cohort. Need for PRBC, FFP, Platelet, and Cryoprecipitate transfusion was not statistically significant between two groups. Within previous protocol cohort 7 ECMO circuits required change-out due to clotting. No circuits needed change after institution of anti-Xa based anticoagulation protocol with no increase in significant bleeding complications.
Conclusion: Utilizing anti-Xa for heparin monitoring during neonatal respiratory ECMO provides safe and more therapeutic anticoagulation while minimizing clotting and bleeding complications.
